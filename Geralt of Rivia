Who is Geralt of Rivia:
Geralt of Rivia is a legendary witcher of the School of the Wolf active throughout the 13th century. He was born to the sorceress Visenna and a warrior named Korin, and was left with the witchers at the stronghold of Kaer Morhen. He was subjected to the Trial of the Grasses, and displayed unusual tolerance for the mutagens that grant witchers their abilities. As a result, he was subjected to further experimental mutagens which rendered his hair white and gave him greater speed, strength, and stamina than his fellow witchers. He adopted the surname "of Rivia" to appear more trustworthy to potential clients, and was later knighted by Queen Meve of Lyria for his valor in the Battle for the Bridge on the Yaruga. Geralt is known for his love of the sorceress Yennefer, and for becoming the adoptive father of Ciri.
