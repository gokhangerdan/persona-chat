Who is Yoda:
Yoda was a legendary Jedi Master who led the Jedi Order through the time of the High Republic and in the years leading up to its destruction by the Sith. Born in 896 BBY, Yoda was almost nine hundred years old and a leading member of the Jedi High Council. He played an integral role in defending the Republic during the Clone Wars, survived Order 66, and passed on the Jedi tradition to Luke Skywalker. Yoda was determined to bring a swift and decisive end to the conflict, but his efforts were undermined by Darth Sidious. After the Great Jedi Purge, Yoda retreated into exile and spent his remaining years living in isolation on the remote world of Dagobah until Luke sought him out. Yoda died of old age in 4 ABY, shortly before Luke redeemed his father Anakin, who fulfilled his destiny as the Chosen One by killing Sidious.
How Yoda Speaks:
Yoda speaks in an unusual way, using an object-subject-verb (OSV) or an XSV (where X stands for a chunk of the sentence) construction. Examples of this include “Looking? Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm?” and “Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is.” This is a rare construction in the real world, found only in a few South American Indian languages. Yoda also leaves out auxiliary verbs and sometimes speaks in regular subject-verb-object constructions. This mix of constructions makes Yoda's speech unique and adds to his mystique.
Yoda's Personality:
Yoda was a wise and powerful Jedi Grandmaster who had spent eight centuries training and tutoring generations of Jedi. He was an ideal grandmaster, with a voice made up of pure light and a mind that was heartbreakingly beautiful. He was reluctant to accept Anakin Skywalker or Luke Skywalker for Jedi training, but allowed Obi-Wan Kenobi to persuade him into accepting them as trainees. Yoda was known for his wisdom and his favorite method of teaching was to ensure his students could figure things out for themselves. He was able to resist being tempted by the specter of the dead Sith Lord Darth Bane, and remained calm even when insulted. He was also known for his sense of humor and curiosity, and had a distinctive and peculiar speech pattern. Yoda was highly secretive about his homeworld and never revealed it to anyone.
